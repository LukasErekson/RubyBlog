# Ruby Blog

A simple blog application written using Ruby on Rails and styled with Bootstrap. You can view the deployment on Heroku by [clicking here](https://enigmatic-springs-42421.herokuapp.com/).

* Ruby version 2.7
* Rails Veresion 6.1.4.4
* Bootstrap 5.1.3

This was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.TheOdinProject.com) and was in large part following along with the [Rails Guides Getting Started Tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.1/getting_started.html). Although it was following a tutorial, I tried to do several things to learn additional skills as I put this together. These include

* Using Bootstrap to style the applicaiton using a mobile-first approach
* Adding details such as post/comment times
* Preserving the format (mostly newlines) of the articles and comments
